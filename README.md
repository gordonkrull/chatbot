# Basic Twitch Chatbot and Dashboard

This is a project just for fun to do some development in my spare time.

The repository is separated into two parts --  the Twitch bot itself (which uses tmi.js under the hood to connect to Twitch channels) and a dashboard where you can view a history of chat messages that were captured while the bot was active.
